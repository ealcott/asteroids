# Classifying Hazardous Asteroids

Data Source: 
https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_query.html#!#results
California Institute of Technology Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Small-Body Database Query. NASA.

I completed this project in Python Jupyter Notebooks. I cleaned the sbdb_query_results in asteroids_cneos.ipynb and saved the clean dataset to 
asteroids.csv. "logreg_initial.ipynb" shows my exploratory ML model, logistic regression. "RF_XGB_FINAL.ipynb" shows my ensemble method for predicting 
whether or not asteroids will be hazardous.
